1. Perform the following transformations from the representation in the in-
dicated radix into decimal:
  * 1223.31 (4) =
  * 2137.21 (8) =
  * B0E.C2 (15) =
  * 888.8 (9) =

2.  Write a program for the conversion of rational numb ers from a p ositional
numb er system in some radix r1 into some other in radix r2

3.  Using your programs as well as by hand, p erform the following transfor-
mations:
  * into decimal: 5632.61(7), 991.18(12), 100011101.1101(2)
  * from decimal: 123.41, 738.61, 3492.61, 2048.09 into radices 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 16
  * arbitrary: 333.33(4), C0C.0A(16), C0C.0A(15), 110110100011111.0111(2) into radices 3, 8, 11, 13, 16

4.  Carry out the following transformations (into the corresp onding p ositional
 radix indicated in each case):
  * 35.625 (10) into radices 2, 3
  * 99.99 (10) into radices 5, 9;
  * 111.111 (7) into radices 8, 5, 2;
  * BAABF.A009 (16) into radices 4, 8;
  * 81817776100.3331 (9) into radix 27;
  * 11101110111.1110111 (2) into radices 4, 8, 16;
  * 818137123.61713861 (9) into radix 27;
  *  ABAB0.A13145631AB (16) into radix 8;
